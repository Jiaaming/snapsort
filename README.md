SnapSort leverages OpenCV for image processing and allows you to quickly sort your photos into categorized folders for easy management.

## Features
- **Focus Classification**: Detect whether a photo is in focus or blurry.
- **Exposure Classification**: Identify overexposed and underexposed images.
- **Content Classification**: Distinguish between landscape and portrait images.
- **Customizable**: Choose which classification method to apply using command-line arguments.
